# **Knowledge Base - Personal Vault in Obsidian**

This repository contains my Obsidian vault, where I centralize my notes, projects, and studies. The system was designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, using a carefully limited folder structure complemented by a robust system of tags and links.

## **System Principles**

### **Limited Hierarchy**
The system adopts a controlled depth structure, allowing only one level of nesting within the main folders. This decision is based on proven knowledge management principles:

- **Access Efficiency**: Maximum of two clicks to reach any information
- **Complexity Reduction**: Avoids "analysis paralysis" when deciding where to store notes
- **Redundancy Prevention**: Minimizes content duplication
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Facilitates content organization and reorganization

### **Flexibility through Tags and Links**
Instead of using deep folder hierarchies, the system uses:
- Tags for multidimensional categorization
- Links to create natural connections between content
- MOCs (Maps of Content) to visualize hierarchies when needed

## **Folder Structure**

### **Main Folders:**
